# LEARNING DIARY

**28.8.2020**

I studied the general information from moodle and my first impression was that this course is a basic course for front-end development. I chose this module because I thought that I might learn something new about modern front-end frameworks like vue, react or angular. I was also hoping that I might learn more about typescript in this course. Even though this course may not be perfect for me, I still want to go through the exercises because I might learn something new.

I set up my environment with VSCode and signed up for a GitHub account. I skipped the intro videos for Git because I am already familiar with.
